gods i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want having a son and friends since julius caesar who at philippi the good brutus ghosted there saw you laboring for him what was ’t that moved pale cassius to conspire and what made the all-honored honest roman brutus with the armed rest courtiers of beauteous freedom to drench the capitol but that they would have one man but a man and that is it hath made me rig my navy at whose burden the angered ocean foams with which i meant to scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father take your time thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails we’ll speak with thee at sea at land thou know’st how much we do o’ercount thee at land indeed thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house but since the cuckoo builds not for himself remain in ’t as thou mayst be pleased to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you there’s the point which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth

with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted that’s our offer know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience though i lose the praise of it by telling you must know when caesar and your brother were at blows your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you let me have your hand i did not think sir to have met you here the beds i’ th’ east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by ’t since i saw you last there’s a change upon you well i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal well met here

i pompey no antony take the lot but first or last your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there you have heard much i have fair meanings sir and fair words to them then so much have i heard and i have heard apollodorus carried no more of that he did so what i pray you a certain queen to caesar in a mattress i know thee now how far’st thou soldier well and well am like to do for i perceive four feasts are toward let me shake thy hand i never hated thee i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior sir i never loved you

i deny my land service but give me your hand menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing all men’s faces are true whatsome’er their hands are but there is never a fair woman has a true face no slander they steal hearts we came hither to fight with you for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune if he do sure he cannot weep ’t back again you’ve said sir we looked not for mark antony here pray you is he married to cleopatra caesar’s sister is called octavia true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus but she is now the wife of marcus antonius pray you sir ’tis true then is caesar and he forever knit together if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties i think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation who would not have his wife so not he that himself is not so which is mark antony he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here and thus it may be come sir will you aboard i have a health for you i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt come let’s away
