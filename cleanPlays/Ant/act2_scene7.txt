the disposition he cries out reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion why this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave to be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move in ’t are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks thus do they sir they take the flow o’ th’ nile by certain scales i’ th’ pyramid they know by th’ height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest you’ve strange serpents there ay lepidus your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile they are so sit and some wine a health to lepidus i am not so well as i should be but i’ll ne’er out not till you have slept i fear me you’ll be in till then nay certainly i have heard the ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things without contradiction i have heard that pompey a word say in mine ear what is ’t forsake thy seat i do beseech thee captain and hear me speak a word forbear me till anon this wine for lepidus what manner o’ thing is your crocodile it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates what color is it of of it own color too ’tis a strange serpent ’tis so and the tears of it are wet will this description satisfy him with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure go hang sir hang tell me of that away do as i bid you where’s this cup i called for if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me rise from thy stool i think th’ art mad the matter i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes thou hast served me with much faith what’s else to say be jolly lords these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink wilt thou be lord of all the world what sayst thou wilt thou be lord of the whole world that’s twice how should that be but entertain it and though thou think me poor i am the man will give thee all the world hast thou drunk well no pompey i have kept me from the cup thou art if thou dar’st be the earthly jove whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine if thou wilt ha ’t show me which way these three world-sharers these competitors are in thy vessel let me cut the cable and when we are put off fall to their throats all there is thine ah this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on ’t in me ’tis villainy in thee ’t had been good service thou must know ’tis not my profit that does lead mine honor mine honor it repent that e’er thy tongue hath so betrayed thine act being done unknown i should have found it afterwards well done but must condemn it now desist and drink for this i’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more who seeks and will not take when once ’tis offered shall never find it more this health to lepidus bear him ashore i’ll pledge it for him pompey here’s to thee menas enobarbus welcome fill till the cup be hid there’s a strong fellow menas why he bears the third part of the world man seest not the third part then is drunk would it were all that it might go on wheels drink thou increase the reels come this is not yet an alexandrian feast it ripens towards it strike the vessels ho here’s to caesar i could well forbear ’t it’s monstrous labor when
