tush never tell me i take it much unkindly that thou iago who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this ’sblood but you’ll not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off-capped to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffed with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for says he and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damned in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the togèd consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership but he sir had th’ election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christened and heathen must be beleed and calmed by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and i god bless the mark his moorship’s ancient by heaven i rather would have been his hangman why there’s no remedy ’tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to th’ first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor i would not follow him then o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followed you shall mark many a duteous and knee-crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master’s ass for naught but provender and when he’s old cashiered whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmed in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern ’tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am what a full fortune does the thick-lips owe if he can carry ’t thus call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such chances of vexation on ’t as it may lose some color here is her father’s house i’ll call aloud do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves what is the reason of this terrible summons what is the matter there signior is all your family within are your doors locked why wherefore ask you this zounds sir you’re robbed for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is tupping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say what have you lost your wits most reverend signior do you know my voice not i what are you my name is roderigo the worser welcome i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee and now in madness being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet sir sir sir but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee patience good sir what tell’st thou me of robbing this is venice my house is not a grange most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you’ll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse you’ll have your nephews neigh to you you’ll have coursers for cousins and jennets for germans what profane wretch art thou i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs thou art a villain you are a senator this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo sir i will answer anything but i beseech you if ’t be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and everywhere straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you strike on the tinder ho give me a taper call up all my people this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already light i say light farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producted as if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some check cannot with safety cast him for he’s embarked with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stands in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hell pains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raisèd search and there will i be with him so farewell it is too true an evil gone she is and what’s to come of my despisèd time is naught but bitterness now roderigo where didst thou see her o unhappy girl with the moor sayst thou who would be a father how didst thou know ’twas she o she deceives me past thought what said she to you get more tapers raise all my kindred are they married think you truly i think they are o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood fathers from hence trust not your daughters’ minds by what you see them act is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused have you not read roderigo of some such thing yes sir i have indeed call up my brother o would you had had her some one way some another do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me pray you lead on at every house i’ll call i may command at most get weapons ho and raise some special officers of night on good roderigo i will deserve your pains
