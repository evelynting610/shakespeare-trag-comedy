they never whisper never my lord nor send you out o’ th’ way never to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing never my lord that’s strange i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there’s no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander bid her come hither go she says enough yet she’s a simple bawd that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore a closet lock and key of villainous secrets and yet she’ll kneel and pray i have seen her do ’t my lord what is your will pray you chuck come hither what is your pleasure let me see your eyes look in my face what horrible fancy’s this some of your function mistress leave procreants alone and shut the door cough or cry if anybody come your mystery your mystery nay dispatch upon my knees what doth your speech

lost him i have lost him too had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction had they rained all kind of sores and shames on my bare head steeped me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fixèd figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnered up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose-lipped cherubin ay there look grim as hell i hope my noble lord esteems me honest o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne’er been born alas what ignorant sin have i committed was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear ’t what committed impudent strumpet by heaven you do me wrong are not you a strumpet no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none what not a whore no as i shall be saved is ’t possible o heaven forgive us i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello you mistress

friends to be called would it not make one weep it is my wretched fortune beshrew him for ’t how comes this trick upon him nay heaven doth know i will be hanged if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander i will be hanged else fie there is no such man it is impossible if any such there be heaven pardon him a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones why should he call her who keeps her company what place what time what form what likelihood the moor’s abused by some most villainous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow o heaven that such companions thou ’dst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to th’ west speak within door o fie upon them some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor you are a fool go to alas iago what shall i do to win my lord again good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him here i kneel if e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love i cannot say it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world’s mass of vanity could make me i pray you be content ’tis but his humor the business of the state does him offense and he does chide with you if ’twere no other it is but so i warrant hark how these instruments summon to supper the messengers of venice stays the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well how now roderigo i do not find that thou deal’st justly with me what in the contrary every day thou daff’st me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered will you hear me roderigo faith i have heard too much and your words and performances are no kin together you charge me most unjustly with naught but truth i have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none well go to very well i cannot go to man nor ’tis not very well by this hand i say ’tis very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it very well i tell you ’tis not very well i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you you have said now ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing why now i see there’s mettle in thee and even from this

mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio how do you mean removing him why by making him uncapable of othello’s place knocking out his brains and that you would have me to do ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his honorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to
