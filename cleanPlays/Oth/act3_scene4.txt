do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies i dare not say he lies anywhere why man he’s a soldier and for me to say a soldier lies ’tis stabbing go to where lodges he to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie can anything be made of this i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat can you inquire him out and be edified by report i will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well to do this is within the compass of man’s wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it where should i lose that handkerchief emilia i know not madam believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking is he not jealous who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him look where he comes i will not leave him now till cassio be called to him how is ’t with you my lord well my good lady o hardness to dissemble how do you desdemona well my good lord give me your hand this hand is moist my lady it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here’s a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels ’tis a good hand a frank one you may indeed say so for ’twas that hand that gave away my heart a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts i cannot speak of this come now your promise what promise chuck i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief here my lord that which i gave you i have it not about me not no faith my lord that’s a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it ’twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made a gift of it my father’s eye should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wived to give it her i did so and take heed on ’t make it a darling like your precious eye to lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition as nothing else could match is ’t possible ’tis true there’s magic in the web of it a sybil that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewed the work the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens’ hearts i’ faith is ’t true most veritable therefore look to ’t well then would to god that i had never seen ’t ha wherefore why do you speak so startingly and rash is ’t lost is ’t gone speak is ’t out o’ th’ way heaven bless us say you it is not lost but what an if it were how i say it is not lost fetch ’t let me see ’t why so i can but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives come come you’ll never meet a more sufficient man the handkerchief i pray talk me of cassio the handkerchief a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you the handkerchief i’ faith you are to blame zounds is not this man jealous i ne’er saw this before sure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it ’tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food they eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us look you cassio and my husband there is no other way ’tis she must do ’t and lo the happiness go and importune her how now good cassio what’s the news with you madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honor i would not be delayed if my offense be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortune’s alms alas thrice-gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you is my lord angry he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffed his own brother and is he angry something of moment then i will go meet him there’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry i prithee do so something sure of state either from venice or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men’s natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object ’tis even so for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to a sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborned the witness and he’s indicted falsely pray heaven it be state matters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you alas the day i never gave him cause but jealous souls will not be answered so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they’re jealous it is a monster begot upon itself born on itself heaven keep that monster from othello’s mind lady amen i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i’ll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost i humbly thank your ladyship ’save you friend cassio what make you from home how is ’t with you my most fair bianca i’ faith sweet love i was coming to your house and i was going to your lodging cassio what keep a week away seven days and nights eightscore eight hours and lovers’ absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times o weary reck’ning pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence sweet bianca take me this work out o cassio whence came this this is some token from a newer friend to the felt absence now i feel a cause is ’t come to this well well go to woman throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth from whence you have them you are jealous now that this is from some mistress some remembrance no by my faith bianca why whose is it i know not neither i found it in my chamber i like the work well ere it be demanded as like enough it will i would have it copied take it and do ’t and leave me for this time leave you wherefore i do attend here on the general and think it no addition nor my wish to have him see me womaned why i pray you not that i love you not but that you do not love me i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night ’tis but a little way that i can bring you for i attend here but i’ll see you soon ’tis very good i must be circumstanced
