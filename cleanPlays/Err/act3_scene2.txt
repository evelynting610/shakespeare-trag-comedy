a beast not that i being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me what is she a very reverend body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without he say i have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage how dost thou mean a marry sir she’s the kitchen wench and all grease and i know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light i warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a poland winter if she lives till doomsday she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world what complexion is

could not do it what’s her name nell sir but her name and three quarters that’s an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip then she bears some breadth no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe i could find out countries in her in what part of her body stands ireland marry sir in her buttocks i found it out by the bogs where scotland i found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand where france in her forehead armed and reverted making war against her heir where england i looked for the chalky cliffs but i could find no whiteness in them but i guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between france and it where spain faith i saw it not but i felt it hot in her breath where america the indies o sir upon her nose all o’erembellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain who sent whole armadas of carracks to be ballast at her nose where stood belgia the netherlands o sir i did not look so low to conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me called me dromio swore i was assured to her told me what privy marks i had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that i amazed ran from her as a witch and i think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel she had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i’ th’ wheel go hie thee presently post to the road an if the wind blow any way from shore i will not harbor in this town tonight if any bark put forth come to the mart where i will walk till thou return to me if everyone knows us and we know none ’tis time i think to trudge pack and be gone as from a bear a man would run for life so fly i from her that would be my wife there’s none but witches do inhabit here and therefore ’tis high time that i were hence she that doth call me husband even my soul doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace of such enchanting presence and discourse hath almost made me traitor to myself but lest myself be guilty to self wrong i’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song master
