the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur and the heedful slave is wandered forth in care to seek me out by computation and mine host’s report i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart see here he comes how now sir is your merry humor altered as you love strokes so jest with me again you know no centaur you received no gold your mistress sent to have me home to dinner my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad that thus so madly thou didst answer me what answer sir when spake i such a word even now even here not half an hour since i did not see you since you sent me hence home to the centaur with the gold you gave me villain thou didst deny the gold’s receipt and told’st me of a mistress and a dinner for which i hope thou felt’st i was displeased i am glad to see you in this merry vein what means this jest i pray you master tell me yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth think’st thou i jest hold take thou that and that hold sir for god’s sake now your jest is earnest upon what bargain do you give it me because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport but creep in crannies when he hides his beams if you will jest with me know my aspect and fashion your demeanor to my looks or i will beat this method in your sconce call you it so you would leave battering i had rather have it a an you use these blows long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders but i pray sir why am i beaten dost thou not know nothing sir but that i am beaten shall i tell you why ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore first for flouting me and then for urging it the second time to me was there ever any man thus beaten out of season when in the and the is neither rhyme nor reason well sir i thank you thank me sir for what marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing i’ll make you amends next to give you nothing for something but say sir is it dinnertime no sir i think the meat wants that i have in good time sir what’s that basting well sir then ’twill be dry if it be sir i pray you eat none of it your reason lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting well sir learn to jest in good time there’s a time for all things i durst have denied that before you were so choleric by what rule sir marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself let’s hear it there’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature may he not do it by fine and recovery yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit why but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity for what reason for two and sound ones too nay not sound i pray you sure ones then nay not sure in a thing falsing certain ones then name them the one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things marry and did sir namely e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world’s end will have bald followers i knew ’twould be a bald conclusion but soft who wafts us yonder ay ay antipholus look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects i am not adriana nor thy wife the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear that never object pleasing in thine eye that never touch well welcome to thy hand that never meat sweet-savored in thy taste unless i spake or looked or touched or carved to thee how comes it now my husband o how comes it that thou art then estrangèd from thyself i call it being strange to me that undividable incorporate am better than thy dear self’s better part ah do not tear away thyself from me for know my love as easy mayst thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf and take unmingled thence that drop again without addition or diminishing as take from me thyself and not me too how dearly would it touch thee to the quick shouldst thou but hear i were licentious and that this body consecrate to thee by ruffian lust should be contaminate wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stained skin off my harlot brow and from my false hand cut the wedding ring and break it with a deep-divorcing vow i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it i am possessed with an adulterate blot my blood is mingled with the crime of lust for if we two be one and thou play false i do digest the poison of thy flesh being strumpeted by thy contagion keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed i live distained thou undishonorèd plead you to me fair dame i know you not in ephesus i am but two hours old as strange unto your town as to your talk who every word by all my wit being scanned wants wit in all one word to understand fie brother how the world is changed with you when were you wont to use my sister thus she sent for you by dromio home to dinner by dromio by me by thee and this thou didst return from him that he did buffet thee and in his blows denied my house for his me for his wife did you converse sir with this gentlewoman what is the course and drift of your compact i sir i never saw her till this time villain thou liest for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart i never spake with her in all my life how can she thus then call us by our names unless it be by inspiration how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave abetting him to thwart me in my mood be it my wrong you are from me exempt but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine thou art an elm my husband i a vine whose weakness married to thy stronger state makes me with thy strength to communicate if aught possess thee from me it is dross usurping ivy brier or idle moss who all for want of pruning with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion to me she speaks she moves me for her theme what was i married to her in my dream or sleep i now and think i hear all this what error drives our eyes and ears amiss until i know this sure uncertainty i’ll entertain the offered fallacy dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner o for my beads i cross me for a sinner this is the fairy land o spite of spites we talk with goblins owls and sprites if we obey them not this will ensue they’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not dromio thou dromio thou snail thou slug thou sot i am transformèd master am i not i think thou art in mind and so am i nay master both in mind and in my shape thou hast thine own form no i am an ape if thou art changed to aught ’tis to an ass ’tis true she rides me and i long for grass ’tis so i am an ass else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me come come no longer will i be a fool to put the finger in the eye and weep whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate husband i’ll dine above with you today and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
