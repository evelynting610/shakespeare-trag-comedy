sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet-like they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my grip thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if ’t be so for banquo’s issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancors in
