compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here that would i had i kingdoms to give with her and you say you will have her when i bring her that would i were i of all kingdoms king you say you’ll marry me if i be willing that will i should i die the hour after but if you do refuse to marry me you’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd so is the bargain you say that you’ll have phoebe if she will though to have her and death were both one thing i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter you yours orlando to receive his daughter keep you your word phoebe that you’ll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd keep your word silvius that you’ll marry her if she refuse me and from

else will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster by my faith he is very swift and sententious according to the fool’s bolt sir and such dulcet diseases but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming audrey as thus sir i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was this is called if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself this is called if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true this is called if again it was not well cut he would say i
