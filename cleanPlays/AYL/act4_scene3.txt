how say you now is it not past two o’clock and here much orlando i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep look who comes here my errand is to you fair youth my gentle phoebe did bid me give you this i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenor pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix ’od’s my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device no i protest i know not the contents phoebe did write it come come you are a fool and turned into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone-colored hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but ’twas her hands she has a huswife’s hand but that’s no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man’s invention and his hand sure it is hers why ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women’s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant-rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phoebe’s cruelty she phoebes me mark how the tyrant writes can a woman rail thus call you this railing did you ever hear such railing meaning me a beast call you this chiding alas poor shepherd do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees west of this place down in the neighbor bottom the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place but at this hour the house doth keep itself there’s none within if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for it is no boast being asked to say we are orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he i am what must we understand by this some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stained i pray you tell it when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o’ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approached the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinked itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush’s shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for ’tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural but to orlando did he leave him there food to the sucked and hungry lioness twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked are you his brother was ’t you he rescued was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him ’twas i but ’tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am but for the bloody napkin by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother’s love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripped himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recovered him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind why how now ganymede sweet ganymede many will swoon when they do look on blood there is more in it cousin ganymede look he recovers i would i were at home we’ll lead you thither i pray you will you take him by the arm be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a man’s heart i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well-counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heigh-ho this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest counterfeit i assure you well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man so i do but i’ faith i should have been a woman by right come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards good sir go with us that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go
