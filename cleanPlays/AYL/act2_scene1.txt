now my co-mates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons’ difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter’s wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forkèd heads have their round haunches gored indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banished you today my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequestered stag that from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much markèd of the melancholy jaques stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream quoth he then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends quoth he anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him quoth jaques thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what’s worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assigned and native dwelling place and did you leave him in this contemplation we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then he’s full of matter i’ll bring you to him straight
