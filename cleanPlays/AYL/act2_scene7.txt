i think he be transformed into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him he saves my labor by his own approach why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily a fool a fool i met a fool i’ th’ forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and basked him in the sun and railed on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool quoth i quoth he and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack-luster eye says very wisely quoth he when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep-contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motley’s the only wear what fool is this o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammed with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat thou shalt have one it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most gallèd with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man’s folly is anatomized even by the squand’ring glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do what for a counter would i do but good most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th’ embossèd sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the weary very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city-woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbor or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wronged him if it do him right then he hath wronged himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaimed of any man but who comes here forbear and eat no more why i have eat none yet nor shalt not till necessity be served of what kind should this cock come of art thou thus boldened man by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seem’st so empty you touched my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answerèd an you will not be answered with reason i must die what would you have your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness i almost die for food and let me have it sit down and feed and welcome to our table speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whate’er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have looked on better days if ever been where bells have knolled to church if ever sat at any good man’s feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what ’tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolled to church and sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendered and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministered then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love till he be first sufficed oppressed with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return i thank you and be blessed for your good comfort thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theater presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in all the world’s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress’ eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon’s mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slippered pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything welcome set down your venerable burden and let him feed i thank you most for him so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself welcome fall to i will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes give us some music and good cousin sing if that you were the good sir rowland’s son as you have whispered faithfully you were and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limned and living in your face be truly welcome hither i am the duke that loved your father the residue of your fortune go to my cave and tell me good old man thou art right welcome as thy master is support him by the arm give me your hand and let me all your fortunes understand
