how now spirit whither wander you i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear farewell thou lob of spirits i’ll be gone our queen and all her elves come here anon the king doth keep his revels here tonight take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite called robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labor in the quern and bootless make the breathless huswife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm those that call you and you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he thou speakest aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip’s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and cries and falls into a cough and then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there but room fairy here comes oberon and here my mistress would that he were gone ill met by moonlight proud titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairyland and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steep of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskined mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from perigouna whom he ravishèd and make him with fair aegles break his faith with ariadne and antiopa these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summer’s spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by pavèd fountain or by rushy brook or in the beachèd margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land hath every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain the plowman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard the fold stands empty in the drownèd field and crows are fatted with the murrain flock the nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blessed therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems’ thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazèd world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman set your heart at rest the fairyland buys not the child of me his mother was a vot’ress of my order and in the spicèd indian air by night full often hath she gossiped by my side and sat with me on neptune’s yellow sands marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him how long within this wood intend you stay perchance till after theseus’ wedding day if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts give me that boy and i will go with thee not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away we shall chide downright if i longer stay well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury my gentle puck come hither thou rememb’rest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea-maid’s music i remember that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armed a certain aim he took at a fair vestal thronèd by the west and loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupid’s fiery shaft quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon and the imperial vot’ress passèd on in maiden meditation fancy-free yet marked i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milk-white now purple with love’s wound and maidens call it fetch me that flower the herb i showed thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league i’ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes having once this juice i’ll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb i’ll make her render up her page to me but who comes here i am invisible and i will overhear their conference i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia the one i’ll stay the other stayeth me thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood and here am i and wood within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia hence get thee gone and follow me no more you draw me you hard-hearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you do i entice you do i speak you fair or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be usèd as you use your dog tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee and i am sick when i look not on you you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me i’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valor flies i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we cannot fight for love as men may do we should be wooed and were not made to woo i’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer ay there it is i pray thee give it me i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lulled in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enameled skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this i’ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow fear not my lord your servant shall do so
