before the duke peter quince what sayest thou bully bottom there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please first pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide how answer you that by ’r lakin a parlous fear i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done not a whit i have a device to make all well write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight will not the ladies be afeard of the lion i fear it i promise you masters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in god shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to look to ’t therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect or or or and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner well it shall be so but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight doth the moon shine that night we play our play a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find out moonshine find out moonshine yes it doth shine that night why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisbe says the story did talk through the chink of a wall you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast about him to signify wall or let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper if that may be then all is well come sit down every mother’s son and rehearse your parts

is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could but i will not stir from this place do what they can i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid what angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry never so i pray thee gentle mortal sing again mine ear is much enamored of thy note so is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape and thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me on the first view to say to swear i love thee methinks mistress you should have little reason for that and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays the more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion thou art as wise as thou art beautiful not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn out of this wood do not desire to go thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no i am a spirit of no common rate the summer still doth tend upon my state and i do love thee therefore go with me i’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee and they shall fetch thee jewels

butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes nod to him elves and do him courtesies hail mortal hail hail hail i cry your worships mercy heartily i beseech your worship’s name cobweb i
