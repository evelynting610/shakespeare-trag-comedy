late behind the wood seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begged my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairyland and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and gentle puck take this transformèd scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this night’s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream but first i will release the fairy queen now my titania wake you my sweet queen my oberon what visions

hear the music of my hounds uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester we will fair queen up to the mountain’s top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayed the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemed all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewed so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crook-kneed and dewlapped like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tunable was never holloed to nor cheered with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedar’s helena i wonder of their being here together no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace of our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice it is my lord go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now pardon my lord i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity my lord i shall reply amazèdly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i think for truly would i speak and now i do bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stol’n away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followed them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it is my love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betrothed ere i saw hermia but like a sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will forevermore be true to it fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three we’ll hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta these things seem small and undistinguishable like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds methinks i see these things with parted eye when everything seems double so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him yea and my father and hippolyta and he did bid us follow to the temple why then we are awake let’s follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams when my cue comes call me and i will answer my next is hey-ho peter quince flute the bellows-mender snout the tinker starveling god’s my life stolen hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream methought i was there is no man can tell what methought i was and methought i had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man’s hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death
