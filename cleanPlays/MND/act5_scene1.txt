’tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helen’s beauty in a brow of egypt the poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet’s pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancy’s images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable here come the lovers full of joy and mirth joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after-supper and bedtime where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate here mighty theseus say what abridgment have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first we’ll none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules that is an old device and it was played when i from thebes came last a conqueror that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony and and that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehearsed i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed what are they that do play it hard-handed men that work in athens here which never labored in their minds till now and now have toiled their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial and we will hear it no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain to do you service i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies i love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged and duty in his service perishing why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing he says they can do nothing in this kind the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposèd to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practiced accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i picked a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity so please your grace the prologue is addressed let him approach if we offend it is with our goodwill that you should think we come not to offend but with goodwill to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end consider then we come but in despite we do not come as minding to content you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know this fellow doth not stand upon points he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisbe is certain this man with lime and roughcast doth present that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall’s chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lantern dog and bush of thorn presenteth for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus’ tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which hight by name the trusty thisbe coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisbe’s mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broached his boiling bloody breast and thisbe tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain i wonder if the lion be to speak no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisbe did whisper often very secretly this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper would you desire lime and hair to speak better it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord pyramus draws near the wall silence o grim-looked night o night with hue so black o night which ever art when day is not o night o night alack alack alack i fear my thisbe’s promise is forgot and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that stand’st between her father’s ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this but what see i no thisbe do i see o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me the wall methinks being sensible should curse again no in truth sir he should not is thisbe’s cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me my cherry lips have often kissed thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisbe’s face thisbe my love thou art my love i think think what thou wilt i am thy lover’s grace and like limander am i trusty still and i like helen till the fates me kill not shafalus to procrus was so true as shafalus to procrus i to you o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall i kiss the wall’s hole not your lips at all wilt thou at ninny’s tomb meet me straightway ’tide life ’tide death i come without delay thus have i wall my part dischargèd so and being done thus wall away doth go now is the wall down between the two neighbors no remedy my lord when walls are so willful to hear without warning this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them it must be your imagination then and not theirs if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i as snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion’s dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place ’twere pity on my life a very gentle beast and of a good conscience the very best at a beast my lord that e’er i saw this lion is a very fox for his valor true and a goose for his discretion not so my lord for his valor cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valor for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present he should have worn the horns on his head he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff i am aweary of this moon would he would change it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time proceed moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon i the man i’ th’ moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe this is old ninny’s tomb where is my love o well roared lion well run thisbe well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace well moused lion and then came pyramus and so the lion vanished sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams i trust to take of truest thisbe sight but stay o spite but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here eyes do you see how can it be o dainty duck o dear thy mantle good what stained with blood approach ye furies fell o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail crush conclude and quell this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad beshrew my heart but i pity the man o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear which is no no which was the fairest dame that lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop thus die i thus thus thus now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky tongue lose thy light moon take thy flight now die die die die die no die but an ace for him for he is but one less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes and thus she means moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead ay and wall too no i assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe’s garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed ’tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatched this palpable-gross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity
