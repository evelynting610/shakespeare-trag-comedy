was not count john here at supper i saw him not how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he is of a very melancholy disposition he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady’s eldest son evermore tattling then half signior benedick’s tongue in count john’s mouth and half count john’s melancholy in signior benedick’s face with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if he could get her goodwill by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue in faith she’s too curst too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god’s sending that way for it is said but to a cow too curst he sends none so by being too curst god will send you no horns just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woolen you may light on a husband that hath no beard what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd and lead his apes into hell well then go you into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long well niece i trust you will be ruled by your father yes faith it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle i’ll none adam’s sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight the revelers are entering brother make good room lady will you walk a bout with your friend so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away with me in your company i may say so when i please and when please you to say so when i like your favor for god defend the lute should be like the case my visor is philemon’s roof within the house is jove why then your visor should be thatched speak low if you speak love well i would you did like me so would not i for your own sake for i have many ill qualities which is one i say my prayers aloud i love you the better the hearers may cry god match me with a good dancer amen and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done answer clerk no more words the clerk is answered i know you well enough you are signior antonio at a word i am not i know you by the waggling of your head to tell you true i counterfeit him you could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man here’s his dry hand up and down you are he you are he at a word i am not come come do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to mum you are he graces will appear and there’s an end will you not tell me who told you so no you shall pardon me nor will you not tell me who you are not now that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of well this was signior benedick that said so what’s he i am sure you know him well enough not i believe me did he never make you laugh i pray you what is he why he is the prince’s jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me when i know the gentleman i’ll tell him what you say do do he’ll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there’s a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night we must follow the leaders in every good thing nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remains and that is claudio i know him by his bearing are not you signior benedick you know me well i am he signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamored on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it how know you he loves her i heard him swear his affection so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight come let us to the banquet thus answer i in name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio ’tis certain so the prince woos for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero count claudio yea the same come will you go with me whither even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer’s chain or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero i wish him joy of her why that’s spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus i pray you leave me ho now you strike like the blind man ’twas the boy that stole your meat and you’ll beat the post if it will not be i’ll leave you alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince’s fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i’ll be revenged as i may now signior where’s the count did you see him troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the goodwill of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped to be whipped what’s his fault the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest shows it his companion and he steals it wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealer yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird’s nest i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince’s jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her look here she comes will your grace command me any service to the world’s end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john’s foot fetch you a hair off the great cham’s beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy you have no employment for me none but to desire your good company o god sir here’s a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it you have put him down lady you have put him down so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek why how now count wherefore are you sad not sad my lord how then sick neither my lord the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion i’ faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i’ll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say to it speak count ’tis your cue silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither in faith lady you have a merry heart yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart and so she doth cousin good lord for alliance thus goes everyone to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry lady beatrice

lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter your silence most offends me

niece will you look to those things i told you of i cry you mercy uncle by your grace’s pardon by my troth a pleasant-spirited lady there’s little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit she were an excellent wife for benedick o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad county claudio when mean you to go to church tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules’ labors which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection th’ one with th’ other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights’ watchings and i my lord and you too gentle hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valor and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practice on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift
