speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing termagant it out-herods herod pray you avoid it i warrant your honor be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th’ accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work and the queen too and that presently bid the players make haste will you two help to hasten them ay my lord what ho horatio here sweet lord at your service horatio thou art e’en as just a man as e’er my conversation coped withal o my dear lord nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flattered no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune’s buffets and rewards hast ta’en with equal thanks and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger to sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passion’s slave and i will wear him in my heart’s core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father’s death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damnèd ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan’s stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and ’scape detecting i will pay the theft they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place how fares our cousin hamlet excellent i’ faith of the chameleon’s dish i eat the air promise-crammed you cannot feed capons so i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine no

vouchsafe me a word with you sir a whole history the king sir ay sir what of him is in his retirement marvelous distempered with drink sir no my lord with choler your wisdom should show itself more

affair i am tame sir pronounce the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you you are welcome nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed if it shall please

denmark ay sir but the proverb is something musty o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe my lord i cannot i pray you believe me i cannot i do beseech you i know no touch of it my lord it
