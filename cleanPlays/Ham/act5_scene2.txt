so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance remember it my lord sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there’s a divinity that shapes our ends rough-hew them how we will that is most certain up from my cabin my sea-gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark’s health and england’s too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off is ’t possible here’s the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed i beseech you being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman’s service wilt thou know th’ effect of what i wrote ay good my lord an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma ’tween their amities and many suchlike of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed how was this sealed why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father’s signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th’ other subscribed it gave ’t th’ impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea-fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to ’t why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow ’tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensèd points of mighty opposites why what a king is this does it not think thee stand me now upon he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th’ election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is ’t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is ’t not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there it will be short the interim’s mine and a man’s life’s no more than to say but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i’ll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow’ring passion peace who comes here your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly no my good lord thy state is the more gracious for ’tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess ’tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use ’tis for the head i thank your lordship it is very hot no believe me ’tis very cold the wind is northerly it is indifferent cold my lord indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as ’twere i cannot tell how my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter i beseech you remember nay good my lord for my ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more your lordship speaks most infallibly of him the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath sir is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue you will to ’t sir really what imports the nomination of this gentleman of laertes his purse is empty already all ’s golden words are spent of him sir i know you are not ignorant i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he’s unfellowed what’s his weapon rapier and dagger that’s two of his weapons but well the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has impawned as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit what call you the i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done the carriages sir are the hangers the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal-conceited carriages that’s the french bet against the danish why is this all as you call it the king sir hath laid sir that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits shall i deliver you e’en so to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will i commend my duty to your lordship yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for ’s turn this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time i am constant to my purposes they follow the king’s pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now the king and queen and all are coming down in happy time the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play she well instructs me you will lose my lord i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart but it is no matter nay good my lord it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now ’tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is ’t to leave betimes let be come hamlet come and take this hand from me give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon ’t as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was ’t hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta’en away and when he’s not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if ’t be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet’s enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o’er the house and hurt my brother i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honor i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it i embrace it freely and will this brothers’ wager frankly play give us the foils come on come one for me i’ll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night stick fiery off indeed you mock me sir no by this hand give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds this is too heavy let me see another this likes me well these foils have all a length ay my good lord set me the stoups of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet’s better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark’s crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye come on sir come my lord one no judgment a hit a very palpable hit well again stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here’s to thy health give him the cup i’ll play this bout first set it by awhile come another hit what say you a touch a touch i do confess ’t our son shall win he’s fat and scant of breath here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet good madam gertrude do not drink i will my lord i pray you pardon me it is the poisoned cup it is too late i dare not drink yet madam by and by come let me wipe thy face my lord i’ll hit him now i do not think ’t and yet it is almost against my conscience come for the third laertes you do but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me say you so come on nothing neither way have at you now part them they are incensed nay come again look to the queen there ho they bleed on both sides how is it my lord how is ’t laertes why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric i am justly killed with mine own treachery how does the queen she swoons to see them bleed no no the drink the drink o my dear hamlet the drink the drink i am poisoned o villainy ho let the door be locked treachery seek it out it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain no med’cine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour’s life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomed the foul practice hath turned itself on me lo here i lie never to rise again thy mother’s poisoned i can no more the king the king’s to blame the point envenomed too then venom to thy work treason treason o yet defend me friends i am but hurt here thou incestuous murd’rous damnèd dane drink off this potion is thy union here follow my mother he is justly served it is a poison tempered by himself exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my father’s death come not upon thee nor thine on me heaven make thee free of it i follow thee i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu you that look pale and tremble at this chance that are but mutes or audience to this act had i but time as this fell sergeant death is strict in his arrest o i could tell you but let it be horatio i am dead thou livest report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane here’s yet some liquor left as thou ’rt a man give me the cup let go by heaven i’ll ha ’t o god horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall i leave behind me if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story what warlike noise is this young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to th’ ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley o i die horatio the potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy th’ election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with th’ occurrents more and less which have solicited the rest is silence o o o o now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither where is this sight what is it you would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search this quarry cries on havoc o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfilled that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks not from his mouth had it th’ ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads all this can i truly deliver let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performed even while men’s minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royal and for his passage the soldier’s music and the rite of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss go bid the soldiers shoot
