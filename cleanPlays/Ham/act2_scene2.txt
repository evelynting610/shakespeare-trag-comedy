our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king’s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle

him ay amen th’ ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully returned thou still hast been the father of good news have i my lord i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet’s lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to th’ ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son’s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage well we shall sift him welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew’s levies which to him appeared to be a preparation ’gainst the polack but better looked into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th’ assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more considered time we’ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well-took labor go to your rest at night we’ll feast together most welcome home this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad call i it for to define true madness what is ’t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he’s mad ’tis true ’tis true ’tis pity and pity ’tis ’tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise that’s an ill phrase a vile phrase is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus came this from hamlet to her good madam stay awhile i will be faithful this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she received his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honorable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had played the desk or table-book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or looked upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak and then i prescripts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repelled a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for do you think ’tis this it may be very like hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said when it proved otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the center how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i’ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall’n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i’ll board him presently o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet well god-a-mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you are a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that’s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i’ th’ sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to ’t how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i’ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward though this be madness yet there is method in ’t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that’s out of the air how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my lord i will take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is god save you sir my honored lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not overhappy on fortune’s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news none my lord but that the world’s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark’s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o’ th’ worst we think not so my lord why then ’tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one ’tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows shall we to th’ court for by my fay i cannot reason we’ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord anything but to th’ purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no what say you nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o’erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for ’t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed are they not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aerie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains ’em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to-do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is ’t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little ’sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th’ appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north-north-west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts haply he is the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir a monday morning ’twas then indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord buzz buzz upon my honor then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou what a treasure had he my lord why still on my daughter am i not i’ th’ right old jephthah if you call me my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well nay that follows not what follows then my lord why and then you know the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend why thy face is valanced since i saw thee last com’st thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by ’r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we’ll e’en to ’t like french falconers fly at anything we see we’ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech what speech my good lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million ’twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in ’t i chiefly loved ’twas aeneas’ tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam’s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see ’tis not so it begins with pyrrhus so proceed you ’fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion this is too long it shall to the barber’s with your beard prithee say on he’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba that’s good is good look whe’er he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes prithee no more ’tis well i’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god’s bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall ’scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we’ll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play ay my lord we’ll ha ’t tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in ’t could you not ay my lord very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i’ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord ay so good-bye to you now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what’s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak like john-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i’ th’ throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha ’swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon-livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave’s offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a-cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon ’t foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i’ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i’ll observe his looks i’ll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t’ assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i’ll have grounds more relative than this the play’s the thing wherein i’ll catch the conscience of the king
